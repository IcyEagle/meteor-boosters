# Meteor-boosters

Meteor boosters simplifies your live. I can perform common "boilerplate" operations using simple commands.

Using Meteor boosters you can:

* initialise new project basing on [Meteor 1.4 file structure concepts](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html#javascript-structure). 
* configure settings files in accorance with the [Settings composition concept](https://github.com/IcyEagle/meteor-boosters/new/master?readme=1#settings-file-composition)

# Settings file composition

_This section explains how the final settings configuration file is produced._

# Quick Start

Get the package

```bash
npm install meteor-boosters
```

Initialise the package from the root of your project

```bash
boost init
```

Setup your project structure

```bash
boost setup
```

Have fun! :)
